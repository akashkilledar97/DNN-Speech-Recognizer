# DNN-Speech-Recognizer
> The Project includes the building of the building of the **speech recognition model for recognising the english speech**.
## Content of project
> The project includes different Machine Learning models and comparisons bettween them and different technique for improving the models.

* ### Models in the project : ### 
1. RNN
2. RNN + TimeDistributed Dense
3. CNN + RNN + TimeDistributed Dense
4. Deeper RNN + TimeDistributed Dense
5. Bidirectional RNN + TimeDistributed Dense
6. Final Model

* ### Comparing the models ###
* ### building the my final model ###
